# Neural Network from Scratch
## Learnings:
- Chapter 9 : BAckpropagation has been the toughest till now, the maths can frustrate you at times,more so because unlike other chapters the language is very confusing
  in this one. The writers could have shown a bit of calculation to show how certain matrix operations were giving our desired results. I had to watch another video,spend entire day,write it on my own to understand it but finally I did. The notebook is messy as of now,and I think it'll take the longest time to write(I'll do it later).
- Always remember and practice how we ended up calculating the activation function outputs and gradients.
- Chapter 10 is also very heavy and interesting.
