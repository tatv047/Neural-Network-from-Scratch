    "- L1 regularization’s penalty is the sum of all the absolute values for the weights and biases.This is a linear penalty as regularization loss returned by this function is directly proportional to parameter values. \n",
    "- L2 regularization’s penalty is the sum of the squared weights and biases. This non-linear approach penalizes larger weights and biases more than smaller ones because of the square function used to calculate the result.\n",
    "- In other words, L2 regularization is commonly used as it does not affect small parameter values substantially and does not allow the model to grow weights too large by heavily penalizing relatively big values. \n",
    "- L1 regularization, because of its linear nature, penalizes small weights more than L2 regularization, causing the model to start \n",
    "being invariant to small inputs and variant only to the bigger ones. That’s why L1 regularization \n",
    "is rarely used alone and usually combined with L2 regularization if it’s even used at all.\n",
    "- Regularization functions of this type drive the sum of weights and the sum of parameters towards 0​, which can also help in cases of exploding gradients (model instability, which might cause weights to become very large values). \n",
    "- Beyond this, we also want to dictate how much of an impact we want this regularization penalty to carry. We use a value referred to as lambda in this equation — where a higher value means a more significant penalty. "
